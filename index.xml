      <description>Name&amp;rsquo;s Thiago, Brazilian name that translates to James or Jacob depending on who you ask.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Engineer from Brazil. Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve often worked in positions supporting Latin America in a mix of Software Developer, Consultant and Sales Engineer. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how I loved the &amp;ldquo;hardcore&amp;rdquo; stuff while in college and end up to be more excited to work in places where technology is a means to an end.</description>

      <description>Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content. It&amp;rsquo;s also called placeholder (or filler) text. It&amp;rsquo;s a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero.</description>
